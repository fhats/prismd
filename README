This is prismd.

This application has only one concern: change some mother-fuckin' lights.

Issue POST requests to prismd with a JSON-formatted body like so:
{
	"data": [
		{
			"r": 125,     # the red component
			"g": 126,     # the green component
			"b": 221,     # the blue component
			"i": 255      # the intensity component
		},
		# ... up to N lights
	]
}
