This is prismd.

This application has only one concern: change some mother-fuckin' lights.

Issue POST requests to prismd with a JSON-formatted body like so:
{
        "lights": {
            0: {
                "r": 0-15,
                "g": 0-15,
                "b": 0-15,
                "i": 0-255,
            },
            1: {
                "r": 0-15,
                "g": 0-15,
                "b": 0-15,
                "i": 0-255,
            }
            # ... -> n lights
        }
    }
