This is prismd.

This application has only one concern: change some mother-fuckin' lights.

Issue POST requests to prismd with a JSON-formatted body like so:
{
        "lights": {
            0: {
                "r": 0-15,
                "g": 0-15,
                "b": 0-15,
                "i": 0-255,
            },
            1: {
                "r": 0-15,
                "g": 0-15,
                "b": 0-15,
                "i": 0-255,
            }
            # ... -> n lights
        }
    }


If you want to test, you need some way of making a fake serial port. You can use socat to do this. Download and install socat (./configure && make && sudo make install),
then run socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0 . socat will print the names of the serial ports it creates. Pass one of them to prismd.py with -s
